while performing testing on hosted domain www.onlinetradinginstitute.in . I did bulk messaging through this email id (info@onlinetradinginstitute.in)  . I was not aware or informed by my domain provider that bulk messaging was not on my subscription so kindly request you to do whitelist my email ip (192.163.236.102) and email address (info@onlinetradinginstitute.in) from your end. I'll take care from next time to avoid such incidents.
